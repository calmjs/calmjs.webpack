Example data
============

These pre-built packages are manually generated from the test cases
found in the ``test_integration`` test module, and is also used for the
``test_webpack_toolchain_dynamic_with_calmjs_various`` test in the
``ToolchainIntegrationTestCase`` class, for stablity testing.  The files
are simply copied from the temporary directory generated by that test,
which can be done by inserting a break point before the comparison of
the parsed trees are done.  Those stored test files here are also used
by the ``test_interrogation`` module to check that the functions that
extract the relevant data are working correctly.
