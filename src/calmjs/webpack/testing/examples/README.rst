Example data
============

These pre-built packages found under the ``${major}.${minor}`` versioned
directories were manually generated with webpack of the same version,
through the test cases found in the ``test_integration`` test module,
for the purpose of verifying that the functions that extract the
relevant data from the generated artifacts are working as intended, and
for stability testing of the generated artifacts.

The files are generated using ``generate_example_bundles`` found in the
``calmjs.webpack.testing.utils`` module, with the files simply copied
from the temporary directory generated by that test, which can be done
by inserting a break point after invocation of that function through the
unittest framework.
