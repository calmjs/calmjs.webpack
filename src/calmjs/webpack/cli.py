    Produce a spec for the compilation through the WebpackToolchain.

    Arguments:

    package_names
        The name of the Python package to source the dependencies from.

    export_target
        The filename for the output, can be an absolute path to a file.
        Defaults to the last package_name with a '.js' suffix added in
        the working_dir; e.g. if package_names is ['a', 'b'], the
        default export_target will be b.js at working_dir.

    working_dir
        The working directory.  If the package specified any extras
        calmjs requirements (e.g. node_modules), they will be searched
        for from here.  Defaults to current working directory.

    build_dir
        The build directory.  Defaults to a temporary directory that is
        automatically removed when done.

    source_registry_method
        The acqusition method for the list of calmjs module registries
        declared for the provided package names.

        'all'
            Traverse the dependency graph for the specified package to
            acquire the declared calmjs module registries to use.
        'explicit'
            Only use the calmjs module registries declared for specified
            packages.
        'none'
            Do not acquire sources.  Useful for creating bundles of just
            the bundle sources.

        Defaults to 'all'.

    source_registries
        If the provided packages did not specify all registries or have
        declared modules in alternative but not explicitly specified
        calmjs module registries, this option can be used to pass an
        explicit list of calmjs module registries to use.  Typical use
        case is to generate tests.

    sourcepath_method
        The acquisition method for the source module to filesystem path
        mapping for the given packages from the source_registries that
        were specified.

        Choices are between 'all', 'explicit' or 'none'.
        Defaults to 'all'.

        'all'
            Traverse the dependency graph for the specified package to
            acquire the sources declared for each of those modules.
        'explicit'
            Only acquire the sources for the specified package.  This
            option requires 'calmjs_compat' be True or it may not
            function as intended.
        'none'
            Do not acquire sources.  Useful for creating bundles of just
            the bundle sources.

        Defaults to 'all'.

    bundlepath_method
        The acquisition method for retrieving explicitly defined bundle
        sources from Node.js module sources for the given packages.

        Choices are between 'all', 'explicit' or 'none'.
        Defaults to 'all'.

        'all'
            Traverse the dependency graph for the specified package and
            acquire the declarations.
        'explicit'
            Only acquire the bundle sources declared for the specified
            package.  This option requires 'calmjs_compat' be True or it
            may not function as intended.
        'none'
            Do not specify any bundle files.

        Defaults to 'all'.

    calmjs_compat
        Enable calmjs compatibility settings

        Add the calmjs webpack module bootstrap module.  When enabled,
        this option modifies the configuration so that for root and amd
        mode, a __calmjs__ module is always required and exported, so
        that the explicit option of *path_method of explicit will work
        as intended.

        This also force the webpack.output.library option for the config
        to be set to '__calmjs__' and overrides the webpack_entry_point
        and calmjs_output_library arguments.

        If this is False, the webpack.output.library option will default
        to the last item of package_names, similar to export_target,
        unless overridden.

        Defaults to True.

    webpack_entry_point
        If set manually, the path resolved by the alias will be used as
        the entry_point instead, and the webpack.output.library will
        also be default to this value.  If the alias is not resolved,
        the build will most certainly fail to produce anything of value.

        Defaults to '__calmjs__', which under the default toolchain flow
        it will be the generated __calmjs_bootstrap__ module.  This
        generated module includes every resolved module mapped by the
        path_methods and they will be available as the modules attribute
        in the exported library.

        Requires calmjs_compat to be False in order for this argument to
        take effect.

    webpack_output_library
        If set manually, the output library will be set to this value;
        defaults to True, which sets automatic generation based on
        calmjs_compat and webpack_entry_point arguments; a False or
        None value implies that this is not to be exported as a library.

        Requires calmjs_compat to be False in order for this argument to
        take effect.
